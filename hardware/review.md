	- 1 x USB-C (supports charging and display output)

The laptop comes with 1 NVME and 1 SATA 3 port. It also has 2 DDR4 RAM slots. The WiFi card is also replaceable. It comes with a 41WH battery.

## Design
The laptop only comes in silver, though in person it looks more like dark grey than what is on the promotional pictures. The A, C and D panels are made of metal while the B panel is plastic. The top panel has 2 character lines on both edges and the Machreator logo is embossed dead center. This gives it an unassuming look and is quite muted compared to the company's other offerings. The lid opens up to 120 degress, being able to open it to 180 degress would have been nice. The underside has 2 small rubber feet in front and a long one at the back, this makes sure that the laptop is elevated from the surface. It also has a row of ventilation slits right over the fan all the way to the RAM slots.  

I like the design, the muted color and simple logo at the back with no bling makes this a professional looking laptop. It feels very sturdy, especially the deck. What lets it down in my opinion is the cheap looking B panel (the bezel on the screen) perhaps changing the color to matte black instead of the same color as body would have made it look more premium.

## Keyboard and Trackpad
The keyboard has good travel and are quite large and has good spacing between them. This makes it easier to type on them and makes it harder to make mistakes while typing. It is backlit with 2 levels of brightness which can be adjusted by pressing FN + <Space Bar>. Arrow keys are large and not compressed as on some other laptops. The keys are smooth and quite prone to finger prints, they also wobble a bit but do not feel loose.  

The trackpad is of decent size and it came with Microsoft precision drivers. There are no physical buttons but the track pad itself can be depressed. It is of decent size, not as big as a Macbook but not as small as some old Thinkpads.
