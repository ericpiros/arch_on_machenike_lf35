# Installing Arch Linux on a Machenike Machcreator LF35 Laptop

## Introduction
The [Machcreator LF35][1] is a good laptop from [Machinike][2]. It has some very generic components in it which makes it an ideal candidate for running Linux. This page will contain my experience with this laptop from purchase, upgrade and installation of Linux on it.  
  
I am currently running [Pop!_OS][3] 20.04 on it with my end goal to install and use vanilla [Arch][4] as my daily driver. My main reason for moving to Arch is to run a light weight system with only the packages that I need and for the enjoyment that I get on customizing my OS. I tried running it on my spare laptop but since I can fallback on my main laptop, I really was not pushed to customize it. Reformatting and installing it on my main machine will force me really learn it.
