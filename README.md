# Installing Arch Linux on a Machenike Machcreator LF35 Laptop

## Introduction
I recently purchased a [Machreator LF35](https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/new-arrivalmachenike-lf35-10th-generation-intel-core-i5-thin-and-light-i5-10210u-nvidia-mx350-graphics-156-inch-full-screen-business-office-student-gaming-laptop-free-warranty-free-gifts-windows-10-best-laptop-2020-i681186641-s1956986420.html?spm=a2o4l.seller.list.108.5d8a693981dXX9&mp=1) laptop during one of Lazada's big sale.  
My intention on buying the laptop was to get a computer which I can use to learn about Linux, Python, and AWS. I wanted it to be portable and light as I do not have fixed space where I can work and learn at home at the moment. I also need a lot of storage as I plan to set up several virtual machines. This also means I need to have something with a lot of RAM.  
This particular model checked all my needs. I had space for 1 NVME drive and 1 SATA3 drive. It had user replacable memory slots. It was under 2KG.  
In this page I plan to detail my journey on acquiring and installing Arch Linux on this machine. You use the links below to jump to the various sections.
